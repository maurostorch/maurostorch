# Principal Software Engineer | Distributed Systems & Event-Driven Architectures | Kafka, Go, Kotlin | Builds Scalable Stuff That Works  

Iâ€™m a Principal Software Engineer who cares more about building systems that actually scale and work in production than buzzwords. My background is in distributed systems, event-driven architectures, and cloud platforms, with hands-on experience in Kafka, Go, and Kotlin. Iâ€™ve led migrations to Kubernetes, built streaming pipelines, and introduced event sourcing and modeling into real product development. I like solving technical problems with clean, testable code and infrastructure that doesnâ€™t collapse under real traffic. Iâ€™m at my best when turning complex requirements into reliable services, helping teams make pragmatic architectural decisions, and keeping products moving forward without drowning in over-engineering.
