# Principal Software Engineer | Distributed Systems & Event-Driven Architectures | Kafka, Go, Kotlin

I’m a Principal Software Engineer who cares about building systems that meets users needs and scale. My background is in distributed systems, event-driven architectures, and cloud platforms, with hands-on experience in Kafka, Go, and Kotlin. I’ve led migrations to Kubernetes, built streaming pipelines and APIs, and introduced event modeling and event sourcing into real product development. I like solving technical problems with clean, testable code and infrastructure that handle real traffic. I feel challenged and motived when turning complex requirements into reliable services, helping teams make pragmatic architectural decisions, and keeping products moving forward by balancing engineering decisions and buisness needs.
